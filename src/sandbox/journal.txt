Sample Journal

In bash, how do I compare the today's date to the latest date in the .txt file which is Tuesday, 24 October 2023

```journal.txt
Monday, 23 October 2023
  â”‚ 
  â”œâ”€â”€ 14:40:59 
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Just figured out this time stamp functionality, pretty cool. Will play 
  â”‚       with it more.
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ 14:42:48 
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ I figured this style of journaling sorta looks like live journal hello
  â”‚       This has to be capped at fourty words, I mean it would sorta look like
  â”‚       this I guess...
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ 14:45:03
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ In effect, what i'm doing here is documenting my internal thoughts as 
  â”‚       meta data for me to analyse later...
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ 19:45:03
      â””â”€â”€ Final message of the day, writing this before I sleep... Goodnight!

Tuesday, 24 October 2023
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ 06:45:02 
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yay ðŸ˜Š I get to wake up and journal all over again!
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ 06:49:02
      â””â”€â”€ Hello again!
```


Desired output of bash program

```output.txt
Tuesday, 24 October 2023
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ 06:45:02 
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Yay ðŸ˜Š I get to wake up and journal all over again!
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ 06:49:02
      â””â”€â”€ Hello again!
```

If I could name "â”œâ”€â”€ ", "â”‚   â””â”€â”€", "â””â”€â”€" into variables, what should I name them?




Assuming


In a bash script, if I make a new entry the previous.txt should become changed.txt
How can I achieve that?

# Tree Constants 
BRANCH="  â”‚"
TIME_STAMP_PAST="  â”œâ”€â”€"
TIME_STAMP_CURRENT="  â””â”€â”€"
CONTINUE_BRANCH="  â”‚   â””â”€â”€"
END_BRANCH="      â””â”€â”€"

```previous.txt
 
  â””â”€â”€ 06:49:02
      â””â”€â”€ Hello world!
```

```changed.txt
  â”œâ”€â”€ 06:49:02 
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hello world!
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ 06:50:07
      â””â”€â”€ I'm added!
```







# Create time stamp
time_stamp = "  â”œâ”€â”€ $TIMESTAMP"
last_entry = "  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ $MESSAGE"  

# Extend time stamp
time_stamp = "  â”œâ”€â”€ $TIMESTAMP"
last_entry = "  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ $MESSAGE"
